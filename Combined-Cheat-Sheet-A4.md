## 🔴 PAGE 1 (FRONT): FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### 📊 TIME VALUE OF MONEY (TVM)

```
Simple Interest:        I = P × r × t

Compound Interest:      FV = PV(1 + r)^t
                       PV = FV / (1 + r)^t

Rule of 72:            Years = 72 ÷ Interest Rate

Future Value Annuity:   FVA = PMT/r × [(1+r)^t - 1]
                       FVA = PMT × [(1+r)^t - 1] / r

Present Value Annuity:  PVA = PMT/r × [1 - 1/(1+r)^t]
                       PVA = PMT × [1 - 1/(1+r)^t] / r
```

**⚡ Quick Check:**
- r = decimal (8% → 0.08)
- Monthly: r÷12, t×12
- FV = Future Value | PV = Present Value

### 💰 FINANCIAL RATIOS

```
Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities

Basic Liquidity Ratio = Liquid Assets / Monthly Expenses
   Target: ≥ 3

Asset-to-Debt Ratio = Total Assets / Total Liabilities
   Target: > 1 (>1=solvent, <1=insolvent)

Debt Service-to-Income = Annual Debt Payments / Gross Income
   Target: ≤ 0.333 (1/3)
   0-10%=Safe | 11-14%=Manageable | 15-18%=Danger | >18%=Crisis

Investment-to-Total Assets = Investment Assets / Total Assets
   20s→10% | 30s→11-30% | 40s+→>30%

Emergency Fund = 3-6 months × (Monthly Income × 0.7)
```

### 💳 TAX BRACKETS (Progressive Tax System)

| Taxable Income | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 8,350 | 10% |
| 8,351 - 33,950 | 15% |
| 33,951 - 82,250 | 25% |
| 82,251 - 171,550 | 28% |
| 171,551 - 372,950 | 33% |
| 372,951+ | 35% |

**Tax Calculation Steps:**
```
1. Gross Income
2. - Adjustments (Student loans, moving expenses)
3. = AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)
4. - Deductions (Standard OR Itemized - choose higher)
5. - Exemptions (3,650 × number of people)
6. = Taxable Income
7. → Calculate tax (each bracket × rate → sum)
8. - Tax Credits (dollar-for-dollar reduction)
9. = Tax Owed/Refund
```

**Standard Deduction:**
- Single: 5,700
- Married (Joint): 11,400

**Marginal vs Average:**
- Marginal = Rate of last dollar earned
- Average = Total Tax / Gross Income

**Tax Credits > Deductions:**
- Credit reduces tax directly: $1,000 credit = $1,000 savings
- Deduction reduces taxable income: $1,000 deduction × Tax Rate = savings

---

### 💳 CREDIT CARD FINANCE CHARGE

```
Periodic Rate = APR / 12

Finance Charge = Average Daily Balance × Periodic Rate

Pay full before Due Date → No Finance Charge ✅
Pay only Minimum → Interest + Compounding ❌
```

**APR Types:**
- Teaser: 0-3.9% (expires → real rate applies)
- Default: 25-30% (late payment/exceed limit)
- Variable: Changes with Prime Rate

---

### 🏦 LOAN INTEREST METHODS

**1. Declining-Balance** (Mortgage, Credit Cards)
```
Interest calculated on remaining balance (decreases monthly)

Month 1:
Interest = Beginning Balance × Periodic Rate
Principal = Payment - Interest
Ending Balance = Beginning - Principal
```

**2. Add-On Method** (Car, Furniture)
```
I = P × R × T
Total Repay = P + I
Monthly Payment = Total / Number of Months
```

**3. Discount Method**
```
I = P × R × T
Amount Received = P - I (interest paid upfront)
Monthly Payment = P / Number of Months
```

**4. Monthly Payment Table**
```
Find from table: (Interest Rate, Number of Months)
→ Get value per $1,000

Monthly Payment = (Table Value) × (Principal/1,000)
Finance Charge = (Payment × Months) - Principal
```

---

### 📈 CASH FLOW STATEMENT

```
Total Income - Total Expenses = Surplus/Deficit

Disposable Income = Income after taxes
Discretionary Income = Income after necessities

Budget Variance = Budgeted - Actual
```

---

### 💵 INCOME & INFLATION

```
Nominal Income Change % = [(New - Old) / Old] × 100

Real Income Change % = Nominal Change % - Inflation %

Real Income = Old Income × (1 + Real Change)
```

---

### 📊 ECONOMIC INDICATORS

**Business Cycle:** Expansion → Peak → Recession → Trough → Expansion (6-8 years)

| Phase | Characteristics | Best Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Expansion** | Economy good, low interest, jobs available | Buy stocks, borrow for house |
| **Peak** | Economy at maximum, inflation starts | Be cautious |
| **Recession** | Economy bad, unemployment increases | Reduce expenses |
| **Trough** | Lowest point | **Buy stocks** (cheap prices) |

**Indicator Types:**
- **Procyclic:** GDP (economy good → high)
- **Countercyclic:** Unemployment (economy good → low)
- **Leading:** Stock Market, Consumer Confidence (predicts future)

**Inflation vs Deflation:**
- Inflation = Prices rise (money loses value) → Measured by CPI
- Deflation = Prices fall → Bad for economy

### 📚 KEY DEFINITIONS

**Financial Success Pyramid:**
```
Spend LESS than you earn
↓
Savings (keep money)
↓
Investment (buy income-generating assets)
↓
Wealth
```

**Haves vs Have-nots:**

---

### 🏦 BALANCE SHEET

**Assets:**
- **Monetary** (cash): Cash, Checking, Savings
- **Tangible** (personal property): Car, House, Clothes
- **Investment** (investments): Stocks, Mutual Funds, Insurance

**Liabilities:**
- **Short-term** (<1 year): Credit cards, Medical bills

**Fair Market Value:** = Current selling price (not purchase price)

**Insolvency:** Net Worth < 0 (debts exceed assets)

---

### 💰 TAX STRATEGIES (Tax Avoidance = Legal)

**Reduce Taxable Income through Employer:**
1. **POP** (Premium-Only) → Health insurance before tax
2. **Transportation Plan** → Transit/parking before tax
3. **FSA** → Medical ($3K) or Child Care ($5K) - use it or lose it!
4. **401(k)** → Retirement + employer match

**Other Strategies:**
- **Postpone Income** → Delay to next year (if lower bracket)
- **Bunch Deductions** → Combine deductions to exceed Standard
- **Buy House** → Interest + property tax deductible

**Itemized Deductions (6 types):**
1. Medical/Dental
2. Taxes Paid
3. Interest Paid

5. Casualty/Theft Loss
6. Job Expenses

---

**Continuous-Debt Test:** Can't pay off within 4 years = Too much debt

---

### 🚨 10 SIGNS OF OVERINDEBTEDNESS

1. Debt exceeds 14% of income
2. Don't know debt amount / Afraid to count
3. No cash → Use card instead / Borrow from friends
4. Pay only Minimum Payment
5. Apply for new card / Request limit increase / Cash Advance
6. Pay late / Skip payments (>1 time/year)
7. Add-on Loans (new loan before old one paid)
8. Debt Consolidation (new loan to pay old)
9. Garnishment (wages deducted)
10. Repossession/Foreclosure (assets seized)

---

### 🏦 BANKING ACCOUNTS

**3 Tools:**
1. **Checking** → Daily payments (Debit Card)
2. **Savings** → Emergency Fund
3. **Money Market** → Higher interest (excess funds)

**Emergency Fund = 3-6 months × Income × 0.7**

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield):**
= Actual interest rate (includes Compounding) → Choose highest

**Fees to Watch:**
- Minimum/Average Balance Fee
- ATM Fee (different bank)
- Transaction Fee (foreign use)
- Late Payment Fee ($40+)

---

### 💳 CREDIT CARD KEY TERMS

**Credit Statement:**
```
Billing Date → Due Date (Grace Period ~2 weeks)

Pay full before Due Date → No interest ✅
Pay late → Late Fee + Credit Score down ❌
```

**Types of Cards:**
- **Bank Credit Card:** Visa, MasterCard, Amex
- **Retail Credit Card:** Store cards (department stores, airlines)

**Cash Advance = Withdraw cash from card:**
→ Very high interest + No Grace Period (Don't do!)

| **Default** | Repossession | Lawsuit |

**Lien:** = Right to seize asset (must release when debt paid)

---

### 📋 BANKRUPTCY (Last Resort)

**Chapter 7:** Sell all assets → Discharge debts

**Chapter 13:** Payment plan 5-7 years

**Consequences:**
- Credit Score ruined (10 years)
- Very difficult to borrow
- Some debts don't disappear (student loans, child support, fines)

### ⚡ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Forget to convert % → decimal

❌ Marginal Tax = entire amount × rate (Wrong! Must use brackets)

❌ Tax Credit = Tax Deduction (Wrong! Credit reduces directly)

❌ Simple Interest = Compound Interest (Wrong! Compound has exponent)

❌ Don't pay credit card in full → Pay interest (Pay full every month!)

❌ Emergency Fund = 3-6 months of income (Wrong! Must × 0.7)

❌ Mix time periods (annual rate with monthly periods)

❌ Use net income instead of gross income for ratios

❌ Include non-liquid assets in liquidity ratio

❌ Confuse nominal and real income

❌ Value assets at purchase price vs. fair market value
