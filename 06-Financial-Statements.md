---

## Balance Sheet Components

### Formula
```
Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities
```

### Assets (What You Own)

#### Monetary Assets (Liquid Assets)
- Cash on hand
- Checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- Savings bonds
- Tax refunds due
- Money owed to you

#### Tangible Assets
- Automobiles, motorcycles, boats
- House, condominium
- Personal property (jewelry, tools, clothing)

#### Investment Assets (Capital Assets)
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Life insurance and annuities
- Retirement accounts (personal and employer-provided)
- Real estate investments

**Valuation**: Fair market value (what willing buyer would pay)

### Liabilities (What You Owe)

#### Short-Term (Current) Liabilities (< 1 year)
- Personal loans
- Credit card balances
- Unpaid professional services
- Taxes unpaid
- Past-due rent, utilities, insurance

#### Long-Term Liabilities (> 1 year)
- Automobile loans
- Real estate mortgages
- Education loans

### Net Worth
- **Calculation**: Assets - Liabilities
- **Meaning**: True measure of financial wealth

---

## Strategies to Increase Net Worth

### Since: Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth

### Method 1: Increase Assets
- Cut back on spending
- Save more money
- Invest wisely
- Increase income

### Method 2: Decrease Liabilities
- Pay off debts
- Avoid new debt
- Refinance high-interest debt

### Method 3: Both
- Most effective approach
- Save income increases instead of spending them

---

## Cash-Flow Statement Components

### Three Sections

#### 1. Income (Cash Coming In)
- Salaries and wages
- Bonuses and commissions
- Public assistance
- Social Security benefits
- Scholarships and grants
- Interest and dividends
- Income from sale of assets
- Other: gifts, tax refunds, rent, royalties, capital gains

#### 2. Expenses (Cash Going Out)

**Fixed Expenses** (same amount each period, inflexible):
- Housing (rent, mortgage)
- Automobile (payment, lease)
- Insurance (life, health, auto)

**Variable Expenses** (considerable control):
- Meals (home or away)
- Utilities (electricity, water, gas, phone)
- Transportation (gas, maintenance, registration)
- Medical expenses
- Entertainment
- Clothing

#### 3. Surplus or Deficit

**Formula:**
```
Surplus (Deficit) = Total Income - Total Expenses
```

**Surplus**: Successfully managing resources, no need to borrow

**Deficit**: Expenses exceed income, need to use savings or borrow

## Budgeting

## Budgeting Process

### Action Before: Set Financial Goals
1. Establish long-term goals
2. Break into intermediate-term goals
3. Create short-term action steps
4. Start small, increase gradually

### Action Before: Make Budget Estimates

**Key Income Terms:**
- **Gross Income**: Total before deductions
- **Take-Home Pay (Disposable Income)**: After taxes and withholdings
- **Discretionary Income**: After paying necessities (housing, food, utilities, car)

**Example:**
- Gross income: $60,000
- Take-home pay: $48,000
- Discretionary income: $18,000

### Action Before: Revise Budget Estimates

**If Expenses > Income:**
1. Earn more income
2. Cut back on expenses
3. Combination of both

**Example:**
- Original: $200 for 4 restaurant meals
- Revised: $120 for 2 nice meals
- Savings: $80

### Action Before: Plan Cash Flows

**Cash-Flow Calendar:**
- Record estimated income and expenses by month
- Identify surplus or deficit months
- Plan ahead for deficits

**Managing Deficits:**
- Curtail expenses
- Increase income
- Use savings
- Borrow (last resort)

**Revolving Savings Fund:**
- Accumulate funds for large irregular expenses
- Meet occasional deficits
- "Borrow from yourself" (no interest!)

### Action During: Control Spending

**Methods:**
1. **Monitor unexpended balances** in each category
2. **Set budget for each shopping trip**
3. **Subordinate/itemized budget**: Detailed listing within category
   - Example: Vacation $1,200 = Motel $700 + Restaurants $300 + Entertainment $200
4. **Envelope system**: Place exact cash amounts in envelopes for strict control

### Action After: Evaluate Progress

**Budget Variance:**
- Difference between budgeted and actual amount
- Common in variable expenses
- Use for feedback in next cycle

**Net Surplus Options:**
1. Carry forward to next month
2. Put into revolving savings fund
3. Build cash reserve in savings account
4. Pay down debt
5. Invest in retirement account
