## What Are Financial Ratios?

### Definition
- **Numerical calculations** to evaluate financial strength and progress
- **Tools/yardsticks** for developing saving, spending, and credit-use patterns
- Simplify evaluation of financial condition

### Purpose
- Assess financial health
- Track progress toward goals
- Identify areas needing improvement
- Compare against recommended benchmarks

## Four Key Financial Ratios

---

## 1. Basic Liquidity Ratio

### Purpose
**"Can I pay for emergencies?"**

### Definition
- Measures number of months you can meet expenses using only liquid assets if income ceases
- Tests emergency preparedness

### Formula
```
Basic Liquidity Ratio = Liquid Assets / Monthly Expenses
```

### Benchmark
- **Recommended**: 3 or higher
- Means: 3 months of expenses in emergency cash reserves

### Interpretation
- **Higher is better**
- Ratio of 3 = Can survive 3 months without income
- Ratio < 3 = Need more emergency savings
- Ratio > 3 = Strong emergency fund

### Example
- Liquid assets: $9,000
- Monthly expenses: $3,000
- Ratio: $9,000 / $3,000 = **3.0** ✓ (Meets recommendation)

---

## 2. Asset-to-Debt Ratio

### Purpose
**"Do I have enough assets compared with liabilities?"**

### Definition
- Compares total assets with total liabilities
- Measures solvency and ability to pay debts

### Formula
```
Asset-to-Debt Ratio = Total Assets / Total Liabilities
```

### Benchmark
- **Recommended**: Greater than 1
- Must be > 1 to be solvent

### Interpretation
- **Higher is better**
- Ratio > 1 = Solvent (own more than you owe)
- Ratio = 1 = Break even
- Ratio < 1 = Insolvent (owe more than you own)

### Example 1: Solvent
- Total assets: $50,000
- Total liabilities: $30,000
- Ratio: $50,000 / $30,000 = **1.67** ✓ (Solvent)

### Example 2: Insolvent (College Student)
- Total assets: $7,960
- Total liabilities: $8,700
- Ratio: $7,960 / $8,700 = **0.915** ✗ (Insolvent)

**Note**: Negative net worth is common for college students

## 3. Debt Service-to-Income Ratio

### Purpose
**"Can I meet my total debt obligations?"**

### Definition
- Compares dollars spent on gross annual debt repayments with gross annual income
- Shows total debt burden
- Includes rent or mortgage payments

### Formula
```
Debt Service-to-Income Ratio = Annual Debt Payments / Gross Annual Income
```

### Benchmark
- **Recommended**: 1/3 (0.333) or less
- Maximum: 36% of gross income

### Interpretation
- **Lower is better**
- Ratio ≤ 0.333 = Manageable debt
- Ratio > 0.333 = Too much debt, difficulty meeting obligations
- Usually decreases with age (car paid off, house paid off)

### Example 1: Good
- Annual debt payments: $18,000
- Gross annual income: $60,000
- Ratio: $18,000 / $60,000 = **0.30** ✓ (Good)

### Example 2: Too High
- Annual debt payments: $25,000
- Gross annual income: $60,000
- Ratio: $25,000 / $60,000 = **0.417** ✗ (Too high)

## 4. Investment Assets-to-Total Assets Ratio

### Purpose
**"Do I need to invest more?"**

### Definition
- Compares value of investment assets with total assets
- Reveals progress toward capital accumulation goals
- Especially important for retirement planning

### Formula
```
Investment Assets-to-Total Assets Ratio = Investment Assets / Total Assets
```

### Benchmark (Age-Based)
- **20s**: 10% appropriate
- **30s**: 11-30% appropriate
- **40s**: Above 30%
- **50s+**: 50% or higher desirable

### Interpretation
- **Higher is better** (for building wealth)
- Shows how much of wealth is working for you
- Low ratio = Too much in non-productive assets

### Example 1: Age 25
- Investment assets: $5,000
- Total assets: $40,000
- Ratio: $5,000 / $40,000 = **0.125 (12.5%)** ✓ (Good for 20s)

### Example 2: Age 45
- Investment assets: $80,000
- Total assets: $200,000
- Ratio: $80,000 / $200,000 = **0.40 (40%)** ✓ (Good for 40s)

## Summary Table

| Ratio | Formula | Benchmark | Goal |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| **Basic Liquidity** | Liquid Assets / Monthly Expenses | ≥ 3 | Higher is better |
| **Asset-to-Debt** | Total Assets / Total Liabilities | > 1 | Higher is better |
| **Debt Service-to-Income** | Annual Debt Payments / Gross Income | ≤ 0.333 | Lower is better |
| **Investment Assets-to-Total Assets** | Investment Assets / Total Assets | Age-dependent | Higher is better |

## How to Use Financial Ratios

### Step 1: Calculate Current Ratios
- Use your balance sheet and cash-flow statement
- Calculate all four ratios

### Step 2: Compare to Benchmarks
- Identify which ratios meet recommendations
- Identify which need improvement

### Step 3: Develop Action Plan
- **Low liquidity?** Build emergency fund
- **High debt-to-income?** Pay down debt
- **Low investment ratio?** Increase investing
- **Asset-to-debt < 1?** Increase assets or pay off debt

### Step 4: Track Progress
- Recalculate ratios quarterly or annually
- Monitor improvement over time
- Adjust strategies as needed

## Practical Examples

### Example: Complete Ratio Analysis

**Given:**
- Liquid assets: $6,000
- Total assets: $45,000
- Total liabilities: $25,000
- Investment assets: $8,000
- Monthly expenses: $2,500
- Annual debt payments: $15,000
- Gross annual income: $50,000

**Calculate:**

1. **Basic Liquidity Ratio**
   ```
   $6,000 / $2,500 = 2.4
   ```
   **Status**: Below 3, need more emergency savings

2. **Asset-to-Debt Ratio**
   ```
   $45,000 / $25,000 = 1.8
   ```
   **Status**: Above 1, solvent ✓

3. **Debt Service-to-Income Ratio**
   ```
   $15,000 / $50,000 = 0.30
   ```
   **Status**: Below 0.333, manageable ✓

4. **Investment Assets-to-Total Assets** (assume age 35)
   ```
   $8,000 / $45,000 = 0.178 (17.8%)
   ```
   **Status**: Within 11-30% range for 30s ✓

**Action Plan:**
- Priority: Increase emergency fund from 2.4 to 3 months
- Need: $2,500 × 3 = $7,500 (need $1,500 more)
