### Inflation & Interest
- **Inflation**: Steady rise in prices (measured by CPI)
- **Deflation**: Sustained decline in prices (leads to recession)

## 💳 Budgeting Process

### Before Budgeting
1. Set financial goals (long, intermediate, short-term)
2. Make budget estimates
3. Revise if expenses > income
4. Plan cash flows
5. Establish revolving savings fund

### During Budgeting
1. Monitor unexpended balances
2. Set budget for each shopping trip
3. Use subordinate budgets
4. Consider envelope system

### After Budgeting
1. Evaluate progress
2. Calculate budget variances
3. Handle net surplus: carry forward, save, pay debt, or invest

## 🏛️ Tax Management

### Eight Steps to Calculate Taxes
1. Determine total income
2. Subtract exclusions → **Gross Income**
3. Subtract adjustments → **AGI**
4. Subtract standard/itemized deductions
5. Subtract exemptions → **Taxable Income**
6. Calculate preliminary tax liability
7. Subtract tax credits
8. Calculate balance due/refund

### Tax Reduction Strategies
1. **Premium-only plan (POP)**: Pretax health insurance
2. **Transportation plan**: Pretax transit/parking
3. **FSA**: Pretax medical ($3K) or child care ($5K) - use it or lose it!
4. **401(k)**: Pretax retirement + employer match
5. **Postpone income**: Delay to next year if lower bracket
6. **Bunch deductions**: Prepay to exceed standard deduction

### Tax Credits (Better than Deductions!)
- Lifetime learning: $2,000
- First-time home buyer: $8,000
- Child tax credit: $1,000 per child
- Energy-savings: $2,500

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Time Value of Money
- ❌ Using percentage instead of decimal (use 0.08, not 8)
- ❌ Mixing time periods (annual rate with monthly periods)
- ❌ Confusing PV and FV

### Financial Ratios
- ❌ Using monthly instead of annual for debt service ratio
- ❌ Using net income instead of gross income
- ❌ Including non-liquid assets in liquidity ratio

### Taxes
- ❌ Multiplying entire income by marginal rate (use progressive!)
- ❌ Confusing marginal and average tax rates
- ❌ Thinking credits and deductions are the same
- ❌ Using both standard and itemized deductions

### General
- ❌ Confusing nominal and real income
- ❌ Valuing assets at purchase price vs. fair market value
- ❌ Ignoring opportunity costs
- ❌ Forgetting to adjust for inflation

## 📝 Quick Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Future Value
**Question:** $1,000 at 8% for 4 years?
```
FV = $1,000(1.08)⁴ = $1,360.49
```

### Example 2: Present Value
**Question:** Need $20,000 in 10 years at 7%?
```
PV = $20,000 / (1.07)¹⁰ = $10,167
```

### Example 3: Rule of 72
**Question:** Double money at 6%?
```
Years = 72 / 6 = 12 years
```

### Example 4: Basic Liquidity Ratio
**Question:** $9,000 liquid, $3,000 monthly expenses?
```
Ratio = $9,000 / $3,000 = 3.0 ✓
```

### Example 5: Real Income
**Question:** 5% raise, 3% inflation?
```
Real change = 5% - 3% = 2%
```

### Example 6: Marginal Tax
**Question:** $1,000 bonus, 25% marginal rate?
```
Tax = $1,000 × 0.25 = $250
Net = $750
```
