## Tax Management Overview

### Goal
- Pay income tax liabilities **in full**, but **not a dime more**
- Adopt tax planning perspective to reduce, defer, or eliminate taxes

### Key Concept
> You pay taxes only on **taxable income** = Total income - (exclusions + adjustments + deductions)

### Main Strategy
- **Reduce taxable income** as much as possible
- **Maintain high total income**

---

## Progressive vs. Regressive Taxes

### Progressive Income Tax
- **Tax rate increases** as taxable income increases
- Higher earners pay higher percentage
- U.S. federal income tax is progressive

### Regressive Income Tax
- As income rises, tax demands **decreasing proportion** of income
- Example: Sales tax (everyone pays same 5% regardless of income)

---

## Marginal Tax Rate vs. Average Tax Rate

### Marginal Tax Rate (MTR)
- **Tax rate on the LAST dollar earned**
- Also called Marginal Tax Bracket (MTB)
- Used for evaluating raises, bonuses, additional income

### U.S. Tax Brackets (Example)
- 10%
- 15%
- 25%
- 28%
- 33%
- 35%

### How Marginal Tax Works

**Example: Susan Bassett**
- Gross income: $60,000
- Exemptions and deductions: $9,350
- Taxable income: $60,000 - $9,350 = **$50,650**

**WRONG Calculation:**
```
$50,650 × 0.25 = $12,662.50 ❌
```

**CORRECT Calculation (Progressive):**
```
First $8,350 × 10% = $835.00
Next $25,600 × 15% = $3,840.00
Remaining $16,700 × 25% = $4,175.00
Total Tax = $8,850.00 ✓
```

**Susan is in 25% marginal bracket** because last dollar taxed at 25%

### Average Tax Rate
- **Proportion of total income paid in taxes**
- Always **less than** marginal tax rate

**Formula:**
```
Average Tax Rate = Total Taxes Paid / Gross Income
```

**Susan's Example:**
```
$8,850 / $60,000 = 14.75%
```

## Eight Steps to Calculate Income Taxes

### Step 1: Determine Total Income
**Includes:**
- Wages and salaries
- Commissions
- Bonuses
- Scholarship and fellowship income
- Annuity and pension income
- Gambling and lottery winnings
- Prizes, contest winnings, rewards
- Interest and dividend income

**Pay-As-You-Go Tax:**
- **Payroll withholding**: Employer takes amount from paycheck, sends to IRS
- **Self-employed**: Must pay estimated taxes quarterly

### Step 2: Determine Gross Income (Subtract Exclusions)
**Gross Income** = All income required to be reported

**Exclusions (NOT taxable):**
- Gifts
- Inherited money or property
- Tuition reduction
- Income tax refunds
- Return of money loaned
- Life insurance benefits

### Step 3: Subtract Adjustments to Income
**Adjustments** = Allowable subtractions from gross income

**Examples:**
- Moving expenses to new job
- Higher-education tuition and fees
- Student loan interest
- Business expenses
- Capital losses
- Qualified retirement account contributions

**Result:** Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

**Example:**
- Gross income: $50,000
- Retirement contribution: $1,000
- AGI: $49,000
- Tax savings: $250 (if in 25% bracket)

### Step 4: Subtract Standard Deduction OR Itemized Deductions
**Choose the LARGER of the two** (cannot use both)

#### Standard Deduction
- Fixed amount for all non-itemizing taxpayers
- About 70% of taxpayers use this
- **Amounts (U.S. example):**
  - Single: $5,700
  - Married filing jointly: $11,400
- Homeowners can add local real estate taxes

#### Itemized Deductions
- List all tax-deductible expenses
- Use if total exceeds standard deduction

**Six Classifications:**
1. Medical and dental expenses
2. Taxes you paid
3. Interest you paid
4. Gifts to charity
5. Casualty or theft losses
6. Job expenses

**Example:**
- Single person's itemized deductions: $6,000
- Standard deduction: $5,700
- **Choose itemized** ($6,000 > $5,700)

### Step 5: Subtract Personal Exemptions
**Exemption** = Legally permitted amount based on number of people supported

**Can claim for:**
- Taxpayer
- Spouse (if filing jointly)
- Children
- Parents
- Other qualifying dependents

**Example:**
- Husband, wife, two children = **4 exemptions**
- U.S.: Each exemption = $3,650

### Step 6: Determine Preliminary Tax Liability

**Taxable Income Formula:**
```
Taxable Income = Gross Income
                 - Adjustments
                 - (Standard Deduction OR Itemized Deductions)
                 - Exemptions
```

**Example:**
```
Gross income:              $56,000
Less adjustments:          -$4,000
Adjusted gross income:     $52,000
Less itemized deductions:  -$8,400
Subtotal:                  $43,600
Less one exemption:        -$3,650
Taxable income:            $39,950
Tax liability:             $6,175
```

### Step 7: Subtract Tax Credits
**Tax Credits** = Dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability

**Credits vs. Deductions:**
- $1,000 deduction in 25% bracket = $250 savings
- $1,000 credit = **$1,000 savings** (much better!)

**Examples of Tax Credits:**
- **Lifetime learning credit**: $2,000 for tuition/education
- **First-time home buyer credit**: $8,000
- **Child tax credit**: $1,000 per qualifying child under 17
- **Energy-savings credit**: $2,500 for solar panels, electric vehicles

### Step 8: Calculate Balance Due or Refund

**If:** Withholding + Estimated Payments > Final Tax Liability
- **Result**: Tax refund

**If:** Withholding + Estimated Payments < Final Tax Liability
- **Result**: Balance due

## Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance

### Tax Evasion (ILLEGAL) ❌
- Deliberately hiding income
- Falsely claiming deductions
- Cheating government
- **Consequence**: Criminal charges, jail time

### Tax Avoidance (LEGAL) ✓
- Reducing tax liability through legal techniques
- Applying knowledge of tax code
- Smart tax planning
- **Benefit**: Increased disposable income

---

## Tax Reduction Strategies

### Strategy 1: Reduce Taxable Income via Employer

**Four Methods:**

#### 1. Premium-Only Plan (POP)
- Withhold pretax salary for health insurance premiums
- Not reported as taxable income

**Example:**
- $480 annually for health insurance
- Tax savings: $480 × 0.43 = **$206**

#### 2. Transportation Reimbursement Plan
- Pretax payroll deduction for work transportation
- Transit passes, parking, etc.

**Example:**
- $600 pretax for transportation
- Tax savings: $600 × 0.43 = **$258**

#### 3. Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
- Pretax funding for qualified expenses
- **Medical FSA**: Max $3,000
- **Child care FSA**: Max $5,000
- **Warning**: Use-it-or-lose-it rule!

**Example:**
- $1,200 medical + $3,000 child care = $4,200
- Tax savings: $4,200 × 0.43 = **$1,806**

#### 4. 401(k) Retirement Plan
- Contributions don't show as taxable income
- Employer often matches contributions

**Example:**
- Contribute $2,000
- Employer matches 50% = $1,000
- Immediate 50% return!
- Plus tax savings on $2,000

### Strategy 2: Postpone Income
- Delay income to next year
- Useful if expect lower tax bracket next year

**Example:**
- Year-end commission: $2,000
- Would push into higher bracket this year
- Request January date instead
- Report next year at lower rate

### Strategy 3: Bunch Deductions
- Shift payment dates to exceed standard deduction
- Prepay deductible items in December

**Example:**
- Current deductible expenses: $5,500
- Standard deduction: $5,700
- Prepay $200 in December
- New total: $5,700+ (now can itemize!)

Tax Savings from Credit = Credit Amount (full dollar value)
```
