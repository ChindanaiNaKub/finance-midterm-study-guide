- Low or falling prices and interest rates

**Effects:**
- Easier to buy homes, cars, expensive goods on credit
- Businesses encouraged to borrow and expand
- Increased consumer demand

**Warning Signs:**
- Demand for credit increases → interest rates rise
- More purchases → upward pressure on prices (inflation)

#### 2. Contraction/Recession Phase
**Characteristics:**
- Zero or negative economic growth
- Economy moves toward recession
- Consumer pessimism about future

**Effects:**
- Reduced buying plans
- Decreased business activity
- Eventually ends and moves to expansion

- Examples: unemployment rate, GDP, inflation rate

### Types of Indicators

#### 1. Procyclic (Procyclical) Indicators
- **Move in same direction** as economy
- Example: **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**
- When economy does well → indicator increases

#### 2. Countercyclic (Countercyclical) Indicators
- **Move in opposite direction** to economy
- Example: **Unemployment**
- When economy does well → indicator decreases

#### 3. Leading Economic Indicators
- **Change before** the economy changes
- Help predict future economic performance

**Key Leading Indicators:**
- **Stock Market**: Declines before economy slows
- **Consumer Confidence Index**: Indicates consumer optimism and willingness to spend
