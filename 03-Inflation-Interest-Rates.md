## Inflation

### Definition
- **Steady rise** in the general level of prices
- Measured using **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

### Causes of Inflation
1. **Excess demand** for goods and services
2. **Increasing costs** of production
3. Supply of money/credit rises faster than supply of goods and services

### Effects of Inflation
- Reduces purchasing power
- Erodes real income
- Affects investment returns

---

## Deflation

### Definition
- **Broad, sustained decline** in prices of goods and services
- Hard to stop once it takes hold

### Effects of Deflation
- Reduced corporate profits
- Declining home values
- Rising unemployment
- Lower incomes
- **Result**: Recession is normally the end result

## Real Income vs. Nominal Income

### Example: John Smith's Raise
**Given:**
- Current salary: $37,000
- New salary: $38,600
- Raise amount: $1,600
- Current inflation: 4.0%

### Calculating Nominal Income Change
```
Nominal change = (38,600 - 37,000) / 37,000 × 100 = 4.3%
```

### Calculating Real Income Change
```
Real income change = Nominal change - Inflation
Real income change = 4.3% - 4.0% = 0.3%
```

### Real Income in Dollars
```
Real income = Nominal income × (1 + real change)
Real income = $37,000 × (1 + 0.003) = $37,111
```

### Analysis
- Nominal raise: $1,600
- Real economic progress: $111
- Lost to inflation: $1,489 ($1,600 - $111)

## Interest Rates

### Federal Funds Rate
- **Definition**: Rate that banks charge one another on overnight loans
- **Benchmark** for business and consumer loans
- **Indicator** of future Fed policy

### How Fed Uses Interest Rates

#### When Economy Slows
- Fed **reduces** federal funds rate
- Lenders reduce rates for short-term loans
- Makes borrowing **less costly**
- Encourages spending

#### When Economy Grows Too Fast
- Fed **raises** federal funds rate
- Reduces borrowing
- Slows down economy
- Controls inflation

## Key Formulas

### Nominal Income Change
```
Nominal change % = (New income - Old income) / Old income × 100
```

### Real Income Change
```
Real change % = Nominal change % - Inflation rate %
```

### Real Income in Dollars
```
Real income = Nominal income × (1 + real change as decimal)
```

## Key Terms & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Inflation** | Steady rise in general price level |
| **CPI (Consumer Price Index)** | Measure of inflation |
| **Deflation** | Sustained decline in prices |
| **Nominal Income** | Actual dollar amount earned |
| **Real Income** | Income adjusted for inflation |
| **Federal Funds Rate** | Rate banks charge each other for overnight loans |
| **Purchasing Power** | What money can actually buy |

---

## Important Relationships

### Inflation Impact Chain
1. Money supply increases faster than goods supply
2. Prices rise (inflation)
3. Purchasing power decreases
4. Real income falls even if nominal income rises

### Fed Interest Rate Policy
```
Economy Slowing → Lower rates → Cheaper borrowing → More spending → Growth
Economy Overheating → Raise rates → Expensive borrowing → Less spending → Cooling
```

---

## Practical Applications

### Evaluating a Raise
**Steps:**
1. Calculate nominal income change percentage
2. Subtract inflation rate
3. Result = real income change
4. Convert to dollars to see actual benefit

### Forecasting Interest Rates
**Watch for:**
- Changes in federal funds rate
- Economic growth indicators
- Inflation trends
- Fed policy announcements

## Exam Tips

- ✅ Know how to calculate real vs. nominal income
- ✅ Understand the difference between inflation and deflation
- ✅ Remember: deflation leads to recession
- ✅ Federal funds rate is a benchmark for other rates
- ✅ Fed lowers rates when economy slows, raises when it overheats
- ✅ Real income = Nominal income adjusted for inflation
- ✅ Practice the calculation: Real change = Nominal change - Inflation

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Confusing nominal and real income
- ❌ Forgetting to convert percentages to decimals in calculations
- ❌ Thinking a raise always means more purchasing power
- ❌ Confusing inflation (rising prices) with deflation (falling prices)
